## Who am I?

I am an extremely passionate full-stack developer and tech enthusiast, dying to make my mark on the industry, so much so that I self-financed Makers Academy in order to achieve my vision. I have a strong knowledge of Javascript and its' frameworks (Express, React and Node) , Ruby & Rails, alongside a multitude of other tools. Looking for a software developer role where I can grow and contribute.

After studying Computer Science at Woking College I spent a year and a half managing a personal portfolio (very successfully) as a day/swing trader. After deciding that I still wanted to pursue a career in software development, I decided to take the leap and enrolled into Makers Academy, this allowed me to grow my previous knowledge exponentially. From Makers, I successfully got my first position in the industry, at Miesh, and grew exponentially in my tenure there.

## Practical Skills

### Thrive under pressure

During my time managing my portfolio as a day/swing trader, I had to make split second decisions which would dictate whether or not I would take a trade. This taught me to manage my emotions, even when stakes were high, and to make calculated decisions and take the appropriate actions in the face of the outcome. One example of this is when I decided to take a measured stake in a company I had researched extensively, but unfortunately the next morning they had a negative press release published about them. This caused the stock to drop rather abruptly, and I had to decide whether or not to take the risk. After careful thought, I chose to reduce my position by half, in order to reduce my exposure - this paid off massively as the stock recovered and I ended up turning a profit.

## Fast learner

This was displayed throughout my time at Makers, but especially over the course of the final project Kusari. For this project I had to learn two new frameworks (React & Django) and become familiar with an entirely new language (Python). This was only possible due to the multiple times I had to learn new technologies and languages throughout my time at Makers.

## Analytical thinker

In my role as a day/swing trader, I had to make decisions based on technical analysis and market data. To accomplish this, I built my own indicators to use within my charting platform. I then used these indicators to visualise and analyse the various different data points, which I would then use to place the stock properly on a watchlist.
